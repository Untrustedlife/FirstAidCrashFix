# Ul's FirstAid Fork
First Aid is a minecraft mod that changes the vanilla health system to be split up into different parts.
Armor is only taken into consideration for the part that is currently being damaged, e.g. when you hurt your foot,
the armor in the foot slot will be damage.
It also introduces debuffs to make your life harder. These can be constant (as long as you don't heal your body) or on hit.
The version by Ichtt has a game/server breaking bug in it. In this version that bug plus some other stuff is fixed.
